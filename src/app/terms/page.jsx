            <h4>ORDERS</h4>
            <p className="text-xs text-gray-400">
              BerlinGonzalez Shop provides 2 different methods to purchase our
              products, ensuring that each user can choose the method that best
              suits their needs. The available methods are as follows: Ordering
              from the Website without login: For those users who prefer a more
              direct option, we offer the possibility to place orders without
              logging in. By simply stating their username and adding
              BerlinGonzalez Shop accounts in the game, users can receive
              cosmetics via the gift feature after a 48-hour waiting period.
              This method only supports card payments. Users will be able to
              select the desired cosmetics from our store and will be redirected
              to the payment process, after which the cosmetics will be
              instantly sent to their in-game account. Ordering via WhatsApp: We
              offer an innovative purchase option via a WhatsApp bot, where the
              user will be required to provide a unique access code for
              verification and execution of the purchase. The details of the
              account where the redemption will take place will be presented,
              and a confirmation from the user will be required to proceed. This
              method stands out for its ease of use and immediate access to
              assistance during the purchase process. By placing an order, you
              offer to purchase the products for the price advertised and
              indicated on the website at the time of purchase. Please check the
              features of the products before placing the order. When a customer
              places an order, BerlinGonzalez Shop will send that customer an
              email whose purpose is to confirm the purchase and payment. This
              confirmation email will be produced automatically so that the user
              has confirmation of their purchase and order details. We reserve
              the right to limit the number of units purchased by each user.
              BerlinGonzalez Shop also reserves the right to limit sales of our
              products by region or jurisdiction. All products sold in
              BerlinGonzalez Shop are final, non-tradeable, they do not store
              any monetary value, and cannot be exchanged for real world
              currency. BerlinGonzalez Shop may cancel any order and not supply
              products if it is reasonable to do so and may change or
              discontinue the availability of products at any time at its sole
              discretion. If an order is cancelled by BerlinGonzalez Shop, any
              payment made for the products will be refunded in full. This does
              not affect your statutory rights. We reserve the right, especially
              in cases where high volumes of purchases by a user are observed,
              to require KYC verification or request additional details related
              to the payment method used for transactions. All new orders are
              considered separately and each is treated individually.

              should the user not be satisfied with the correct price
              communicated on the said product order. Please note that the

            <h4>PAYMENTS</h4>
            <p className="text-xs text-gray-400">
              Customers can pay for products using the following payment
              methods: Credit/Debit Card (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, Amex,
              Diners, etc.) Cryptocurrencies. The customer shall pay the price
              of the product stipulated in the order before the product is
              delivered to the customer according to the method of payment used
              by the customer. The payment will be charged to the payment method
              selected by the customer immediately after placing the order for
              the products purchased. In the case of payment via
              cryptocurrencies, the payment will be processed through the
              customer's wallet in a decentralized manner. Once a transaction is
              processed, we will send an electronic receipt of the transaction
              to the customer's email address. If you find any inconsistency in
              your billing, please contact us through our contact details or you
              can make the claim through the customer service of the relevant
              payment processor. If your card is declined, you will receive an
              error message. No payment will be charged to your card and no
              order will be processed. There may be a pending transaction on
              your account until your card issuing bank withdraws the
              authorization. This usually takes 2 to 5 business days. Your card
              may be declined for a number of reasons, such as insufficient
              funds, AVS (Address Verification System) mismatch, or you have
              entered an incorrect security code. If your payment is declined,
              you will need to provide an alternative payment method or provide
              another card on which payment can be charged and processed. Your
              payment details will be treated securely for the sole purpose of
              processing the purchase of the products. Your payment method
              information will not be stored by us. BerlinGonzalez Shop reserves
              the right to contract any available payment processor.

              BerlinGonzalez Shop attempts to be as accurate as possible.

            <h4>DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS</h4>
            <p className="text-xs text-gray-400">
              While we aim for instant product deliveries, it is essential to
              recognize that these are subject to item availability and certain
              technical and operational limitations. In circumstances where
              errors or complications arise that prevent immediate delivery, we
              will endeavor to communicate any potential delays to our users,
              providing an estimate of the new delivery window as soon as
              possible. It should be noted that, due to in-game operational
              policies, each of the BerlinGonzalez Shop accounts added by our
              customers has a sending limit of 5 gifts per day. This restriction
              may impact our users' ability to purchase, even if BerlinGonzalez
              Shop accounts have been added more than 48 hours in advance. In
              situations where the shipping limitation affects the availability
              to make purchases, we are committed to inform users about the next
              available delivery opportunity. Likewise, we suggest our users to
              increase the number of BerlinGonzalez Shop accounts added to
              improve their purchasing capacity and avoid possible
              inconveniences.
